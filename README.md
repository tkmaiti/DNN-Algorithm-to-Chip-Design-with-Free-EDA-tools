DNN Algorithm to Chip Design with Free EDA tools
Step-by-Step implemention of AI algorithm to Chip:

Install OpenLane free EDA tool and its dependencies
Run DNN model developed at RTL level
Targeting the open source sky130 PDK Google and Skywater.
It consists of approximately 20 steps which includes the following:

Installation of free EDA tools
Creating the DNN Model at RT Level
Setting up the configuration for simulation
Synthesis
Floorplanning
Placement
CTS: Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
Routing
Parasitics Extraction -> Resistance/Capacitance Extraction (RCX)
STA: Static Timing Analysis (Post-PnR)
GDSII Layout
LVS: Layout vs. Schematic
